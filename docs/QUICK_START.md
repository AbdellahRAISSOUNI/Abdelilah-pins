  --primary: 0 72% 51%;        /* Change this for primary color */
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;
  /* ... other color variables */
}
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new file in the appropriate folder
2. Export a default React component
3. Add navigation links if needed

### Modifying Components
- All components are in the `components/` directory
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing patterns for consistency

## 🚀 Ready for API Integration

The application is currently using comprehensive mock data and simulated API calls. To integrate real APIs:

1. **Authentication**: Replace mock functions in `hooks/use-auth.tsx` with JWT backend
2. **Post Generation**: Connect to AI/content generation services (OpenAI, etc.)
3. **Database**: Set up PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM for data persistence
4. **Pinterest**: Integrate Pinterest API for publishing and analytics
5. **Scheduling**: Implement backend cron jobs for automated posting
6. **Analytics**: Connect to real Pinterest analytics API for performance data

See `docs/API_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed integration instructions with code examples.
